# README

#### Basic functionality not implemented

- More tests need to be written
- Was not able to test my implementation of the greeting message

#### Bonus functionality implemented.

- A basic help menu using keyword 'help'
- Message parsing with Regex rather than string manipulation

#### Additional tests to write

- The send and receive message methods within bot controller
- All the methods within the bot helper file
- Integration and E2E tests

#### Interesting and noteworthy choices you made, including external libraries/APIs

- HTTParty ruby gem - simplifies HTTP requests to Facebook
- Annotate ruby gem - automatically comments the appropriate schema for each model
- Shoulda-matchers ruby gem - allows model and controller tests to be written more efficiently
- Implemented a Todo List table, which sets the app up to extend to having multiple todo lists
- A message table to implement future message analysis
